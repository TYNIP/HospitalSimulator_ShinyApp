# SHINY APP - Hospital simulator

Basic web page focused on the visualization and data management of a hospital using the R package "Shiny". The page has basic elements and basic interactives.

### Page Considerations:

- The page is designed to be able to read the csv file "Hospital-Simulator-Arkham.csv".
- In order to see the image on the page it is necessary to create a folder called "www" and put the image there.

***Note: All information used is fictitious. Images and links are not linked to this page at all. Its use is simply to give a better perspective of the page.***
